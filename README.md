# Python Package Template

<!-- PROJECT SHIELDS -->
[![License][license-shield]](LICENSE)
[![GitHub Release][releases-shield]][releases]

This project has been set up to quickly and easily set up a new Python package project instead of copying and modifying files from previous projects every time. For this we use [Copier][copier], which will configure your project based on a questionnaire.

## Feature Summary

* ‚ôªÔ∏è [GitHub Actions][gh-actions] for continuous integration and publishing to PyPI
* üì¶ [Poetry][poetry] for dependency management and packaging
* üõ°Ô∏è [Thrusted publishers][thrusted] for PyPI releases
* üê≥ [Dev Containers][devcontainer] for easy development in VS Code
* ‚¨ÜÔ∏è [Renovate Bot][renovate] for dependency updates
* ‚úÖ [mypy][mypy] for static type checking
* üß™ [Pytest][pytest] for testing and code coverage
* ‚úçÔ∏è [Ruff][ruff] for linting and code formatting
* And much more!

## Create a new project

Ensure you have copier installed via [`pipx`](https://github.com/pypa/pipx):

```shell
pipx install copier
```

Decide where you want to create your new project, run the following command and answer all the questions:

```shell
copier copy --trust gh:klaasnicolaas/pypackage-template ~/path/to/destination
```

Or if you want to use the latest version from the main branch:

```shell
copier copy --trust --vcs-ref=HEAD gh:klaasnicolaas/pypackage-template ~/path/to/destination
```

## Publishing to PyPI

A [GitHub workflow](template/.github/workflows/release.yaml.j2) is included that will automatically publish the packaged work to [PyPI](https://pypi.org/) when a new release is created. To support this, there are some things you need to set up first.

- Create and verify an account on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/account/register/).
- Add a [Trusted Publisher](https://docs.pypi.org/trusted-publishers/creating-a-project-through-oidc/) to your PyPI account.
- Create an Environment in the GitHub repository settings and name it "`release`".

Now, when you [create a new release](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/managing-releases-in-a-repository#creating-a-release) from your repository, a workflow will run and deploy the code to PyPI.

## Unit test coverage

With every commit push to a pull request, a [GitHub workflow](template/.github/workflows/tests.yaml) will automatically run unit tests and output code coverage into an xml file. To easily see if code coverage is changing as a result of new work, you should install the GitHub app: **Codecov**.

- Go to the Codecov app page - https://github.com/apps/codecov
- Click **Configure**
- Select your repository and follow the instructions
- Add the `CODECOV_TOKEN` secret to your repository secrets, you can find the token on the Codecov app page (required since v4.x).

Future pull requests and commits will now include code coverage information.

## Renovate Bot

Renovate checks if updates are available for dependencies and will update them automatically via a pull request. If your repository is set up correctly for [auto-merging](https://docs.renovatebot.com/key-concepts/automerge/), the pull request will also be merged automatically.

- Go to the Renovate Bot app page - https://github.com/apps/renovate
- Click **Configure**
- Select your repository and follow the instructions

After this Renovate will create a GitHub issue in your repository which serves as a dashboard, you can see here which updates are pending and trigger Renovate to check again.

## Automatic Release Drafts

Automatically generate release notes with the [Release Drafter](https://github.com/release-drafter/release-drafter) workflow. This uses the labels from issues and pull requests to draft pretty and detailed release notes for your GitHub releases.

## Updating

Future boilerplate updates can be as simple as:

```bash
copier update --trust --skip-answered
```

In case you want to update your answers to the questions as well as update:

```bash
copier update --trust
```

## Start developing on this template

This Python template project relies on [uv] as its dependency manager,
providing comprehensive management and control over project dependencies.

You need at least:

- [Python] 3.11+ - The programming language
- [uv] - A python virtual environment/package manager

Install all packages, including all development requirements:

```shell
uv sync --dev
```

### Pre-commit hooks

This project uses [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to run some checks before committing code. To install the pre-commit hooks, run the following command:

```shell
uv run pre-commit install
```

### Keep template dependencies up to date

The [pyproject.toml](./template/pyproject.toml.j2) file of the template has a jinja2 extension and is therefore not seen by Renovate bot to update automatically. That's why I keep track of the dependencies separately in a [Gist](https://gist.github.com/klaasnicolaas/323975ac4f173087a979209cd1c8f202) and a [workflow](./.github/workflows/sync-dependencies.yaml) will check every week if anything needs to be adjusted.
