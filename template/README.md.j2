Asynchronous Python client for {{ project_name }}.

## About

<!-- TODO: Add a short description about the project. -->

## Installation

```bash
pip install {{ project_slug }}
```

## Datasets

<!-- TODO: Add a list of datasets that are supported by this package. -->

### Example

import asyncio

from {{ package_name }} import


async def main() -> None:
    """Show example on using this package."""


if __name__ == "__main__":

More examples can be found in the [examples folder](./examples/).

## Contributing

This is an active open-source project. We are always open to people who want to
use the code or contribute to it.

We've set up a separate document for our
[contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).

Thank you for being involved! :heart_eyes:

## Setting up development environment

The simplest way to begin is by utilizing the [Dev Container][devcontainer]
feature of Visual Studio Code or by opening a CodeSpace directly on GitHub.
By clicking the button below you immediately start a Dev Container in Visual Studio Code.

[![Open in Dev Containers][devcontainer-shield]][devcontainer]

This Python project relies on [Poetry][poetry] as its dependency manager,
providing comprehensive management and control over project dependencies.

You need at least:

- Python 3.12+
- [Poetry][poetry-install]

### Installation

Install all packages, including all development requirements:

```bash
poetry install
```

_Poetry creates by default an virtual environment where it installs all
necessary pip packages_.

### Pre-commit

This repository uses the [pre-commit][pre-commit] framework, all changes
are linted and tested with each commit. To setup the pre-commit check, run:

```bash
poetry run pre-commit install
```

And to run all checks and tests manually, use the following command:

```bash
poetry run pre-commit run --all-files
```

### Testing

It uses [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) as the test framework. To run the tests:

```bash
poetry run pytest
```

To update the [syrupy](https://github.com/tophat/syrupy) snapshot tests:

```bash
poetry run pytest --snapshot-update
```
